# AVC-LAN-Master
Firmware for ATMega to Emulate ANY AVC-LAN device

Credit where due:
Many people are the developers of the base code for this project learning how the AVC-LAN worked such as:

Kochetkov Aleksey  AVCLan Mini

I have taken this project a step further.  My version of this code is modularized and will allow you to create ANY device to function on the AVCLAN network, including emulating a AVC-LAN Master device.  You can assign your own AVC-LAN address to this device or emulate a device or simply just use the code to sniff your AVC-LAN network.  You can even make it emulate multiple devices at the same time.  Presently I have used it to emulate my factory radio and information panel in my 2010 Toyota Avalon, replacing both the factory units with my own custom unit.

If you have anything you wish to contribute to this code, please by all means submit it for evalutation.

I have decided to make my code available for others to use non-commercially.  I do not know if my work infringes on copyrights.  If you have specific knowledge that it does or this is based on your code and causes an issue, please let me know.
